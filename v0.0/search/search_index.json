These configuration sources are automatically combined into a single, hierarchical configuration object that the application can use throughout its lifecycle.</p> <p>One of the key characteristics of ASP.NET Core\u2019s configuration system is its built-in support for environment-specific configurations. Developers can create environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json, or appsettings.Production.json, which override settings from the base configuration file. Additionally, environment variables or command-line arguments can further override any configuration values at runtime.

Clients must include a valid token in the Authorization header of each HTTP request, using the following format:</p> <pre><code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The service only accepts JWTs that are issued by a trusted identity provider, the DataGEMS AAI service. This issuer is responsible for authenticating users and issuing tokens with claims that the service can validate. One of the critical claims in the token is the aud (audience) claim. The value of this claim must include the identifier of this service, ensuring that the token was intended to be used with it.</p> <p>When a token is received, the service performs a series of validation steps before granting access to any endpoint. These steps typically include verifying the token\u2019s signature using the public keys published by the trusted issuer, checking the issuer iss claim to confirm it matches the expected DataGEMS AAI issuer, validating the audience aud claim to ensure the token was meant for this service, and checking the token expiration exp to confirm the token is still valid.

The genereted access token can then be used in the HTTP request as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service to Service with Exchanged Credentials: The service, in the context of serving a user request needs to invoke another service. It must forward the credentials it was invoked with to continue the process flow under the scope of the original caller. It will initiate a token exchange flow, presenting it's client id and secret so that the AAI service authorizes the client to exhcnage the requested token, along with the initial access token that needs to be exchanged and the desired scope of the new access token which will indicate the audience / reciever of the generated, exchanged credential.
