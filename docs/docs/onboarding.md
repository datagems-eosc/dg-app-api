The definite guide for integrators remains the service [OpenAPI Reference](openapi.md).

The codebase is available under [EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2 (EUPL v1.2)](license.md) in our [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/datagems-eosc/dg-app-api).

To get a better understanding on features and approaches utilized throughout the HTTP Api interface, you can read about some [Api Constructs](api-overview.md).

To know more about Api response codes and how to interpret them, you can take a look at the [Status & Error Codes](error-codes.md).

On aspect pertaining to security, you can read more at the [Secruity](security.md) section.

For an overall view of the service, you can go through the [Architecture](architecture.md).

For any questions, you can consult the [FAQ](faq.md).

If you are facing a problem, check if there is a relevant [issue](https://github.com/datagems-eosc/dg-app-api/issues) answering your question.

You can always contact us through the [DataGEMS Help Desk](https://datagems.eu/contact-us/).

## Examples

You can find here a postman collection that describes some example calls of the Api. You will need to create an environment and define the following variables:

* userAccessToken: set here the access token retrieved from the DataGEMS AAI service
* baseUrl: set this to the api endpoint you want to use

Depending on the access level of the user that was authenticated and whose access token you have placed in the *userAccessToken* variable, you will be able to utilize the respective endpoints.

The postman collection can be found here: [DataGEMS.dg-app-api.postman-collection.json](content/DataGEMS.dg-app-api.postman-collection.json).
